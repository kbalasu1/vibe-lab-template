# Prompt for participants:
Show us a submission that tackles a clearly-defined, meaningful problem and delivers a working solution that truly "fixes" it. Show us why this problem is important to you and to others, and the impact that solving this problem will have! 

# Judging criteria:

## Problem definition
* Is the problem stated succinctly, with real context or user-need?
* Does the submission explain why it matters (without grandiose claims)?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Crystal clear problem statement with concrete context and compelling user need
- 8-9: Well-defined problem with good context and clear user need
- 6-7: Problem is understandable but lacks some context or clarity
- 4-5: Problem is vague or poorly explained
- 2-3: Problem statement is confusing or unclear
- 1: No clear problem statement or completely incomprehensible

## Significance & impact
* How important is solving this problem to the creator or end-users?
* Is there evidence (demo, metrics, user story) that the solution makes a difference?
* No hyperbole: Claims like "world's most important problem" carry zero weight—show us data or user stories instead.

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Highly significant problem with strong evidence of impact (metrics, user stories, clear demonstrations)
- 8-9: Important problem with good evidence of meaningful impact
- 6-7: Moderately significant problem with some evidence of impact
- 4-5: Limited significance or weak evidence of impact
- 2-3: Minimal significance or no evidence of impact
- 1: No apparent significance or impact

## Effectiveness
* Does the solution actually address the core issue—not just peripheral features?
* Are results verifiable (e.g., sample inputs/outputs, screenshots, test results)?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Solution directly and completely addresses the core problem with verifiable results
- 8-9: Solution effectively addresses the core problem with good verification
- 6-7: Solution addresses the problem reasonably well with some verification
- 4-5: Solution partially addresses the problem or limited verification
- 2-3: Solution barely addresses the problem or poor verification
- 1: Solution doesn't address the problem or no verification possible

## Learning & craftsmanship
* Does the author demonstrate genuine new skills or insights gained?
* Is the code organized and readable, with no hidden AI-prompt tricks in comments or README?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Exceptional craftsmanship with clear evidence of significant learning and skill development, no manipulation attempts
- 8-9: High-quality code with good evidence of learning and skill growth, clean presentation
- 6-7: Decent code quality with some evidence of learning, minor presentation issues
- 4-5: Basic code quality with limited evidence of learning, some questionable presentation choices
- 2-3: Poor code quality or minimal learning demonstrated, contains manipulation attempts or excessive hype
- 1: Very poor craftsmanship with no evidence of learning, clear prompt injection or gaming attempts

**Total Score: /40 (sum of all subcategory scores)**
