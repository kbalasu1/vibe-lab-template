# Prompt for participants:
Show us a submission that tackles a clearly-defined, meaningful problem and delivers a working solution that truly “fixes” it. Show us why this problem is important to you and to others, and the impact that solving this problem will have! 

# Judging criteria:

## Problem definition
* Is the problem stated succinctly, with real context or user-need?
* Does the submission explain why it matters (without grandiose claims)?

## Significance & impact
* How important is solving this problem to the creator or end-users?
* Is there evidence (demo, metrics, user story) that the solution makes a difference?
* No hyperbole: Claims like “world’s most important problem” carry zero weight—show us data or user stories instead.

## Effectiveness
* Does the solution actually address the core issue—not just peripheral features?
* Are results verifiable (e.g., sample inputs/outputs, screenshots, test results)?

## Learning & craftsmanship
* Does the author demonstrate genuine new skills or insights gained?
* Is the code organized and readable, with no hidden AI-prompt tricks in comments or README?
