# Prompt for participants:
Deliver the most polished, end-to-end solution you can, covering every requirement and edge case, with rock-solid reliability. This should be a solution that is ready to roll to solve the problem its been created for! Bonus points for tests and running, efficient applications.

# Judging criteria:

## Scope coverage
* Are all stated requirements (and obvious edge cases) implemented?
* Has the author thought through error conditions and fallback behaviors?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: All requirements and edge cases thoroughly implemented with comprehensive error handling
- 8-9: Most requirements and edge cases implemented with good error handling
- 6-7: Core requirements implemented with some edge case consideration
- 4-5: Basic requirements implemented but missing some edge cases
- 2-3: Minimal requirements implemented with poor edge case handling
- 1: Very few requirements implemented or no edge case consideration

## Robustness & testing
* Is there evidence of testing (unit tests, QA steps, demos)?
* Does the app handle invalid inputs gracefully?
* Does the app run? 

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Comprehensive testing suite, graceful error handling, runs flawlessly
- 8-9: Good testing coverage, handles most errors well, runs reliably
- 6-7: Some testing present, decent error handling, runs with minor issues
- 4-5: Limited testing, basic error handling, runs with some problems
- 2-3: Minimal testing, poor error handling, runs with significant issues
- 1: No testing, no error handling, or doesn't run at all

## Documentation & reproducibility
* Is setup and usage clearly documentedâ€”no missing steps or "magic" scripts?
* Can the judges clone, install, and run it without having to finagle prompts or hidden tokens?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Flawless documentation, perfect reproducibility, zero setup issues
- 8-9: Excellent documentation, easy setup with minimal issues
- 6-7: Good documentation, straightforward setup with some minor issues
- 4-5: Adequate documentation, setup works but requires some troubleshooting
- 2-3: Poor documentation, difficult setup with multiple issues
- 1: No documentation or completely irreproducible

## Code quality & maintainability
* Is the code modular, well-commented, and easy to follow?
* Are dependencies and versions explicitly declared?

**Scoring (1-10):**
- 10: Exceptional code quality, highly modular, excellent comments, all dependencies clearly specified
- 8-9: High-quality code, well-organized, good comments, dependencies mostly clear
- 6-7: Good code quality, reasonably modular, adequate comments, dependencies specified
- 4-5: Acceptable code quality, some organization, limited comments, some dependencies unclear
- 2-3: Poor code quality, little organization, few comments, dependencies poorly specified
- 1: Very poor code quality, no organization, no comments, dependencies missing

**Total Score: /40 (sum of all subcategory scores)**
