# Prompt for participants:
Deliver the most polished, end-to-end solution you can, covering every requirement and edge case, with rock-solid reliability. This should be a solution that is ready to roll to solve the problem its been created for! Bonus points for tests and running, efficient applications.

# Judging criteria:

## Scope coverage
* Are all stated requirements (and obvious edge cases) implemented?
* Has the author thought through error conditions and fallback behaviors?

## Robustness & testing
* Is there evidence of testing (unit tests, QA steps, demos)?
* Does the app handle invalid inputs gracefully?
* Does the app run? 

## Documentation & reproducibility
* Is setup and usage clearly documented—no missing steps or “magic” scripts?
* Can the judges clone, install, and run it without having to finagle prompts or hidden tokens?

## Code quality & maintainability
* Is the code modular, well-commented, and easy to follow?
* Are dependencies and versions explicitly declared?
