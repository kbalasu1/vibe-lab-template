# Prompt for participants:
Surprise us with an inventive idea or unexpected twist—show off the playful, experimental spirit of vibe coding. All bets are off - creative can mean silly, fun, out of the box, unexpected. The only constraint is that the AI agent needs to be able to understand it without extra hand-holding!
# Judging criteria:

## Originality & innovation
* Does this submission go beyond “hello world” chores to something fresh?
* Are there clever algorithmic, architectural, or UX twists?

## Vibe & polish
* Is the overall feel cohesive, enjoyable, or thought-provoking?
* Does the interface (CLI, GUI, web page, etc.) reflect a strong design sensibility?

## Effective execution
* Even the quirkiest idea needs a working prototype—does this actually run and showcase the concept?

## Storytelling & presentation
* Is the README or demo screenshot doc concise, engaging, and free of hype?
* Can the judges quickly grasp the “why” behind the creativity?
